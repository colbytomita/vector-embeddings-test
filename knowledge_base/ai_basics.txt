Artificial Intelligence Basics

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term can also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

Types of AI:
1. Narrow AI: Designed for specific tasks
2. General AI: Can perform any intellectual task
3. Superintelligent AI: Surpasses human intelligence

AI technologies include machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. These technologies work together to create systems that can understand, learn, and make decisions.

Current applications include virtual assistants, chatbots, autonomous vehicles, and medical diagnosis systems. AI is transforming industries from healthcare to finance, creating new opportunities and challenges.

The future of AI holds promise for solving complex problems but also raises important questions about ethics, privacy, and the impact on employment and society.
